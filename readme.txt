Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 3.5
Stable tag: 1.2

Enables high resolution Gravatar images on any browser that supports them.

== Description ==

Automatically replaces the standard resolution Gravatars with HiDPI (Retina) Gravatars using Javascript.

You need this plugin if you want blog comments to look crisp and clear on Retina, HD, and similar devices!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `hidpi-gravatars` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

This is a zero-configuration plugin.  There are no settings.

Deactivation removes everything except the files you uploaded.  There is no "uninstall" necessary.

Theme development note:  You may not omit the wp_footer() tag for this plugin to work correctly.

Personal avatar note:  For best results when uploading a new avatar, use an image at least 128 x 128 pixels in size.  The old "standard" size of 80 pixels will be inadequate on Retina displays.
